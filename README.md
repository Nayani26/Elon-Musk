#AI-Enhanced Job Matching Platform
This project is an AI-powered job-matching platform that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to recommend jobs to users based on their skills. The platform's backend leverages a pre-trained BERT model for NLP tasks, and the frontend allows users to enter their skills and receive recommended job matches in real-time.


Features
NLP-Based Job Matching: Uses BERT embeddings to match user skills with job descriptions.
REST API: The backend is built with FastAPI to handle API requests and return job matches.
User Interface: Simple front end that takes user input and displays job recommendations.


Project Structure
Frontend
The frontend consists of an HTML page that allows users to input their skills and view job recommendations. This interacts with the FastAPI backend.
Backend
The backend is developed in Python using FastAPI, and it serves as an API for the job-matching service. It uses a BERT model to generate embeddings and calculate cosine similarity between user skills and job descriptions.


Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
•	Python 3.7+
•	Node.js and npm (if additional frontend tooling is used)
•	pip for installing Python dependencies


Installation
1.	Clone the repository
              git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-matching-platform.git
             cd job-matching-platform
2.	Set up the backend
 Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
               cd backend
               pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Set up the frontend
If you're using a package manager or frontend build tool, install dependencies. Otherwise, simply open job.html in a browser.


Running the Application
Starting the Backend
To start the FastAPI backend, navigate to the backend directory and run:
bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
The backend server will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.


Starting the Frontend
Open the frontend/job.html file in your browser to load the frontend.


Usage
1.	Enter your skills in the input field provided on the frontend.
2.	Click "Enter skills" to get a list of job recommendations based on the input skills.
3.	The platform will display the most relevant job descriptions with a similarity score.

   
API Endpoints
POST /match-jobs
•	Description: Matches user skills to a list of job descriptions based on similarity scores.
•	Request Body:
json
{
  "user_skills": "machine learning, data visualization, Python",
  "job_descriptions": [
    "Data Scientist with expertise in Python, machine learning, and data visualization.",
    "Software Engineer experienced in JavaScript, React, and backend development."
  ]
}
•	Response:
json
{
  "best_match": "Data Scientist with expertise in Python, machine learning, and data visualization.",
  "similarity_score": 0.87
}


Technologies Used
•	Backend: FastAPI, BERT, PyTorch, sklearn
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
•	Model: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)



Future Enhancements
•	Authentication and User Profiles: Allow users to create accounts and save job preferences.
•	Database Integration: Store job postings and user data in a database for better scalability.
•	Improved Matching Algorithms: Experiment with other models or fine-tune BERT for better matching performance.
